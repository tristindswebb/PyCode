In order to run this bot you will need to create a file named config.py and create a token by typing
TOKEN = "Your token here" - A token can be acquired from registering with the discord API, I suggest following a tutorial :)
you can then run Main.py and it should work.

This is a discord python bot that I use as a testing ground for my own private discord bot.

Anything that has been uploaded here is free for use by anyone who wishes to use it.
